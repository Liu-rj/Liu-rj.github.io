I am a second-year master student at [DBGroup](https://dbgroup.sustech.edu.cn/) in [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/) and [Xiao Yan](https://yanxiaosunny.github.io/). Currently, I am interning at [NYU System Group](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/) advised by Prof. [Jinyang Li](https://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/), working on Graph RAG and agent programming systems.

Prior to that, I got my bachelor degree also at SUSTech and had a wonderful experience during my internship at AWS Shanghai AI Lab, working closely with Dr. [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/) and Dr. [Zhenkun Cai](https://czkkkkkk.github.io/). My research interest primarily focuses on building advanced machine learning systems, previously working on GNN systems and now more paying more attention to LLM applications.

**I am expected to graduate in Summer 2026, and I am actively finding PHD positions!**
